# Augur Fork Meter

A transparent, auditable monitoring system for Augur's fork probability. Provides real-time assessment of the risk that Augur's oracle will enter a fork state based on on-chain dispute activity and security metrics.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Hourly automated calculation of fork risk metrics
- **Transparent Architecture**: All calculations performed via public GitHub Actions
- **Auditable History**: Complete audit trail in git repository
- **No Private Infrastructure**: Uses only GitHub Actions and static JSON storage
- **Interactive UI**: Gauge display with both real data and demo modes

## Quick Start - No API Keys Required!

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Calculate current fork risk (uses public RPCs automatically!)
npm run calculate-fork-risk

# Copy data to public directory for web access
cp data/fork-risk.json public/data/

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

**✅ Zero Configuration**: The system automatically connects to public Ethereum RPC endpoints - no API keys, no registration, no setup required!

## Architecture

### Data Collection
- **GitHub Actions**: Runs hourly to calculate fork risk metrics
- **Public RPC Endpoints**: Connects to free Ethereum RPC services (no API keys!)
- **Verified Contracts**: Uses official Augur v2 mainnet addresses
- **Static Storage**: Results saved to `data/fork-risk.json`
- **Git Audit Trail**: All changes tracked in version control

### Risk Calculation
- **Dispute Bond Tracking**: Monitors size and escalation of dispute bonds
- **Security Ratio**: Assesses REP market cap vs open interest ratio  
- **Fork Threshold**: Calculates percentage of 275,000 REP threshold reached
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combines multiple indicators for overall risk level

### UI Components
- **Real Data Mode**: Displays actual fork risk from JSON file
- **Demo Mode**: Interactive controls for testing and demonstration
- **Risk Visualization**: Gauge display with color-coded risk levels
- **Detailed Metrics**: Shows active disputes, REP staked, security ratios

## Documentation

- **[Methodology](docs/methodology.md)**: Complete explanation of risk calculation methodology
- **[Gauge UI](docs/gauge-ui.md)**: UI component documentation
- **[Augur Whitepaper](docs/augur-whitepaper-v2.pdf)**: Core fork mechanics reference

## Risk Levels

| Level | Description | Fork Threshold % | Security Status |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Low** | Normal operation | <0.5% | Good |
| **Moderate** | Active disputes | 0.5-2% | Monitoring |
| **High** | Large disputes | 2-5% | Concern |
| **Critical** | Fork imminent | >5% | Alert |

## Public RPC Endpoints (No API Keys!)

The system automatically connects to these free, public Ethereum RPC endpoints:

| Provider | Endpoint | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Ankr** | `https://rpc.ankr.com/eth` | Primary endpoint |
| **LlamaRPC** | `https://eth.llamarpc.com` | Public good project |
| **LinkPool** | `https://main-light.eth.linkpool.io` | Community provider |
| **PublicNode** | `https://ethereum.publicnode.com` | Decentralized infrastructure |
| **1RPC** | `https://1rpc.io/eth` | Privacy-focused RPC |

### Failover Strategy
- Automatically tries endpoints in order until one works
- Logs which endpoint is used for transparency
- No rate limiting issues with hourly GitHub Actions
- Zero vendor lock-in - can always switch providers

### Optional Custom RPC
```bash
# Optional: Use your own RPC endpoint
ETH_RPC_URL=https://your-custom-rpc-endpoint.com
```

### GitHub Actions Setup
The monitoring system automatically runs via GitHub Actions. See `.github/workflows/fork-monitor.yml` for configuration.

### Running Calculations Manually
```bash
# Uses public RPCs automatically (no API key needed!)
npm run calculate-fork-risk

# Or with a custom RPC endpoint
ETH_RPC_URL="https://your-rpc-endpoint.com" npm run calculate-fork-risk

# Check which RPC was used
cat data/fork-risk.json | grep -A 5 "rpcInfo"
```

## Transparency and Auditability

This project prioritizes transparency:

1. **Open Source**: All calculation logic is public and auditable
2. **Git History**: Every risk calculation is tracked in version control
3. **No Black Boxes**: No private databases or hidden infrastructure
4. **Reproducible**: Anyone can verify calculations using the same inputs

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes with full test coverage
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit a pull request

## Current Status & Limitations

**✅ What's Working:**
- Real Augur v2 contract addresses and connections
- Public RPC failover system (no API keys needed)
- Transparent, auditable architecture
- Proper error handling (no fake data fallbacks)

**⚠️ Current Limitations:**
- Dispute monitoring uses mock data (real event parsing in development)
- REP price estimation ($15/REP placeholder - price oracle needed)
- Open interest estimates (Universe contract integration pending)
- Limited Augur activity on mainnet (most moved to Polygon)

## Disclaimer

This tool is for informational purposes only. Fork risk assessment is inherently uncertain and this system may not capture all possible risk factors. The current implementation has known limitations documented above. Users should conduct their own analysis and not rely solely on these metrics for critical decisions.
