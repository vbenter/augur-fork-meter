1. Create HTML with SVG Gauge
    - SVG-based circular gauge (semicircle design)
    - Color-coded arc segments for risk zones (green/yellow/red)
    - Animated needle using SVG transforms
    - Data display panels below gauge
2. CSS Animation System
    - CSS transitions for smooth needle rotation
    - Keyframe animations for loading states
    - Responsive scaling using CSS transforms
    - Color transitions for different risk levels
3. Fake Data Integration
    - JavaScript to simulate fork probability (0-100%)
    - Random fluctuations in REP staking data
    - Animated transitions between different risk states
    - Timer-based updates every few seconds
4. Data Structure for Future Integration
    - Fork probability percentage (main needle position)
    - Total REP supply and staked amounts
    - Active dispute count
    - Time since last update
    - Current risk level (low/medium/high)
